REM Produced by GENTEST on Fri Jan 24 19:46:33 2014

REM All inputs and outputs are arrays of 8-bit bytes (octets) with bytes being
REM represented by consecutive pairs of hexadecimal digits (the pair 'ab', for
REM example, yields the byte value 0xab in C). The index positions of bytes in
REM arrays increase by 1 from left to right for each pair of digits and arrays
REM on consecutive lines with the same initial designators are concatenated so
REM that bytes on later lines have higher array indexes.  Numeric significance
REM is undefined except between the two digits that form each individual byte.
